Hello, welcome to "Fish Fish Fish!"!
1. This is a fishing game. You can control a ship by using left and right button.

2. The ship is a fishing ship, so you can drop bomb (by using down button) to capture the fish.

3. If you capture one fish, then your score will plus one, or you missed one fish.

4. However, if you miss 10 fishes or more, the game is over.

5. Last thing I want to point out is the bomb. Since you drop the bomb in the water,
the bomb will be affected by the flow of the water, so the bomb is not vertically droped.
It will has horizontal velocity, same as the fish.

6. Your ship needs time to recharge the bomb, so you need to wait the previous
bomb sunk into the ocean then you can drop the next bomb.

A little trick: wait until the fish exactly pass the downside of the ship,
then drop the bomb.
